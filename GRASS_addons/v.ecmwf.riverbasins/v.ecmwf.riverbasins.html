<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.ecmwf.riverbasins</em> updates the list of all the partner 
institute IDs intersecting with each river basin.

<p>
The aim of this procedure is that for each basin in the hydrological 
model we want to know: 1) what partner regions regions lie within this 
basin. The basins become an attribute called 'MOUids_all' (MOU = 
Memorandum of Understanding) which records a list all the partner 
institute IDs which lie within each river basin.

<p>
The input partner regions store the separate polygon areas for each 
individual partner institute, rather than the dissolved partner regions 
that we have been working with previously.

<p>
The input river basins are given in a separate datasource/layer.

<p>
The workflow is as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Intersect the river basins with the individual (un-dissolved) 
    partner regions shapefile to identify partner regions which 
    intersect with each river basin.
    <li>Loop through each of the river basins.
    <li>Extract the partner ID for each of these partner regions which 
    intersect the corresponding river basin and assign them to the 
    'MOUids_all' attribute of the river basin.
</ol>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Update river basin attributes with new partner regions.

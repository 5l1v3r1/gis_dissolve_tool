<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.ecmwf.riverbasins</em> updates the list of all the partner 
institute IDs which lie within the same river basin as the 5km grid 
point.

<p>
The aim of this procedure is that for each 5km grid point in the 
hydrological model we want to know: 1) which river basin it falls 
within, and then 2) what partner regions regions lie within this basin. 
The 5km grid point has an attribute called 'MOUids_all' (MOU = 
Memorandum of Understanding) which records a list all the partner 
institute IDs which lie within the same river basin as the 5km grid 
point.

<p>
The partner regions come from a different shapefile which stores the 
separate polygon areas for each individual partner institute, rather 
than the dissolved partner regions that we have been working with 
previously.

<p>
The location of the 5km grid points is given in a separate shapefile.

<p>
The river basins are given in the mainbasins shapefile.

<p>
The workflow is as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Intersect the river basins with the individual (un-dissolved) 
    partner regions shapefile to identify partner regions which 
    intersect with each river basin.
    <li>Intersect the 5km grid points with the main river basins to 
    identify the river basin for each 5km grid point.
    <li>Loop through each of the 5km grid points, using the 
    corresponding river basin.
    <li>Extract the partner ID for each of these partner regions which 
    intersect the corresponding river basin and assign them to the 
    'MOUids_all' attribute of the 5km grid point.
</ol>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Update the grid point attributes with new partner regions.
